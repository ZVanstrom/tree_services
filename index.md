Introducing Zee’s Trees: Your Local Tree Care Partner in Fort Wayne

Hello Fort Wayne! I’m thrilled to welcome you to Zee’s Trees, your new go-to for all things tree care in the Summit City. You might be wondering, “Who’s Zee?” Well, I’m a long-time Fort Wayne resident who found my passion among towering oaks and maples, not behind a computer screen. Over the years, I’ve honed my woodworking skills, climbed rock faces around the country, and discovered one unifying theme: a deep love for the outdoors.

At Zee’s Trees, I believe in taking a genuine, down-to-earth approach to every job. Whether it’s pruning, trimming, or even more complex tree removals, I bring the same dedication and focus to your project that I’ve used in my woodworking and climbing pursuits. I’m not just here to cut branches—I’m here to preserve and protect the natural beauty that makes Fort Wayne feel like home.

You can count on friendly service and clear communication every step of the way. My engineering background helps ensure precision and attention to detail, but more importantly, my love for the outdoors fuels every aspect of the work I do. I’m excited to bring my passion for nature, problem-solving, and craft to help keep your trees healthy and your property looking its best.

Thank you for stopping by to learn a little about Zee’s Trees. I can’t wait to roll up my sleeves and get to work for you—together, we’ll help Fort Wayne’s landscape thrive!
